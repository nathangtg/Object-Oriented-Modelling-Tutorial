# Object-Oriented Modeling with Java

## Course Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to object-oriented modeling and design using the Java programming language. Students will learn the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. They will also gain practical experience in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions to real-world problems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and their implementation in Java.
2. Design and implement classes, interfaces, and inheritance hierarchies in Java.
3. Apply the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create robust and maintainable Java programs.
4. Utilize common design patterns to solve complex software engineering problems.
5. Analyze and critique object-oriented designs and suggest improvements.
6. Collaborate effectively in a team-based software development environment.

## Course Outline
1. **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Fundamental OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods, and properties
  - Java syntax and language features

2. **Encapsulation and Information Hiding**
  - Access modifiers and visibility
  - Getter and setter methods
  - Constructors and initialization

3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
  - Inheritance hierarchies and the `extends` keyword
  - Method overriding and the `@Override` annotation
  - Interfaces and abstract classes

4. **Advanced OOP Concepts**
  - Composition and aggregation
  - Interfaces and abstract classes
  - Generics and type parameters

5. **Design Patterns**
  - Creational patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder)
  - Structural patterns (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
  - Behavioral patterns (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Command)

6. **Object-Oriented Design Principles**
  - SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
  - UML diagrams and modeling

7. **Team-Based Software Development**
